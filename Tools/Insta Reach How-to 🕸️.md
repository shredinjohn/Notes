🌟 Looping videos  
  
My most VIRAL reels are 5-7 second videos with looping movements.  
  
No GRWM, DITL, or morning routine videos.  
  
The key is to have something that can LOOP over and over while reading your caption.  
  
🌟 Spacing out captions  
  
Most people SKIM through your captions.  
  
They want to find the key words and ideas.  
  
Space them out and EMPHASIZE words by using emojis❗️  
  
🌟 Trending audio  
  
If your audio has a beat drop around 3-5 second mark, you’ve HIT GOLD!  
  
Sync the BEAT DROP with your CTA to make it more satisfying to watch.  
  
🌟 Value, value, VALUE!
